During this process, I also implement some of complicate algorithm and wrote it into a R package; The other one is the data acquisition system maintenance, Our team has lots of large scale survey.

  - I also have data analysis intern in bayer. I was  participated in data analysis platform building. Using Python and Javascript to build a platform that could make people analysis and visualization data by clicks; besides, I was also response for market/field trailing data analysis and visualization;  
  - I am apply for this job is because the digitization and the chance of knowing front line business. On the one hand, using digital tech to empower and help traditional business is interesting and valued job, on the other hand, it is a  job can take fully advantage of my abilities.

- Short One:
  - Hello, everyone, I am lvchun from HZAU, I am familiar with account and law, and I had passed law certification exam and CPA. Besides, I am familiar with data analysis and I had internship in Bayer.

**What is your biggest challenge? and how do you passed by?** 

- **Situation**: I had build data platform during my bayer internship. This platform is intend to merge data collection, data analysis and data visualization into a single platform. 
- **Target**: The very data visualization is to visualize data in a convenient, easy and powerful way. Convenient means we can visualize data by one or two click; Easy means we can build data visualization template by several click; Powerful means we can visualize data not only in the line chart, pie chart, but also sanky chart, map, or many other fancy different chart type. This is a big and challenge task, ’cause I am familiar with R data visualization, but I know nearly nothing about JavaScript data visualization;
- **Action**: we do this task by several steps:
    - **Divide this big problem into some small question**: the first step is to do survey and demand analysis. It is very hard to deliver the product satisfy those three target in one step. And we also do not need to achieve those three target simultaneously. So, we first analysis those requirement and make a version plan. The 0.1 version is a convenient one, the 0.5 version is a convenient and easy one, the 1.0 version is our target;
    - **Search and Comparing related tools**: There are many candidate solution for us to this target: Echart, Highchart, GoogleChart, D3 and so on. We need to choose one and using it as our foundation. After reading their document, writing small demos and watching their show case, I did some comparison of those product. And we finally choose Echart as our answer.
    - **Learning and Line by Line Coding**: After I choose the Echart, I start my development. Reading its document, startint from its case code, study high level API, then writing the code, unit test, document line by line.
- **Result**: After two weeks of hard coding, In the time I leave, I deliver the 0.5 version, ergo visualization data by click and build simple visual templete by several clicks. The user can build their own data visualization template by several clicks and after that, every time when they want to see this data or chart again, They just need one or two clicks. And I had learned pretty much about JavaScript and Echart in this process.

**What your career plan?** 

- From now on, I am the theory knowledge about data analysis and basic knowledge about data platform building. 
- In the next three to five years, I want to know the whole process of enterprise digitization and the actual front line business. I hope I can become the digitization expert, deliver fully digitization value alone, take a major role in a business line of MN.
