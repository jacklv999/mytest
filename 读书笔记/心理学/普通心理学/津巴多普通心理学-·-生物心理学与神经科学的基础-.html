          <p>For to know about psychology , one thing that we can never<br>negative is our brain : how does it work ? So, it’s main idea for this easy to explain this question for all about you .For a clear publishing ,</p><p>I decide to write this passage from there simple question, for: “how are genes and behavior linked ? “、”how does the body communicate internally ? “、 how does the brain produce behavior and mental process ? “ . And now , let’s go to deal with these question by order .</p><p>The first question : how are genes and behavior linked ?</p><p>For this question , the evolution theory can explain it very well . They said : evolution has fundamentally shaped psychology process because it favors genetic variations that produce adaptive behavior . So this is the fundamental connective between gene and behaviors , but we also want to know why the genes and behavior could be connected ? <br></p><p> And for this question , we should talk about two reason for it .</p><p>First , evolution and natural selection . When the time before our mind first look at world , just the natural behavior can sever us from compaction world , so our lots of behavior had to been write to our genes to prevent stupid behavior which can take dangerous to us . So , too many behaviors had to write in our genes from natural selection .</p><p>Second , genetics and inheritance . The behavior which write to our genes can transport to next generation , when a behavior that can help human survival in world can help this gene transport to next generation, so the inheritance could be useful for the ‘selfness gene’ . The second question : how does the body communicate internally ?</p><p>For a human to live healthful , the corporation between different system is very important for us . And , so important this task is that only brain can take it . For it , the brain coordinates the body’s two communications systems , the nervous system and the endocrine system to communicate with targets throughout the body .</p><p>The third question : how does the brain produce behavior and mental process ?</p><p>We know that the brain is very important in our body , but we also want to know that : what important function does the different part in our brain control ? It’s not enough to just know about the brain stem and associated structures control many vital body function .</p><p>For this , we should talk more about that :</p><p>First ,the limbic system plays vital roles in motivation emotion and memory ;</p><p>Second ,the cerebral system cortex contains highly special modules ;</p><p>Third , the front lobes control speech and mental function ;</p><p>Forth , the parietal lobes specialize in sensation , especially the sense of touch and body position .</p><p>Fifth , the temporal lobes have multiple roles in face recognition , hearing ,smell.</p><div class="image-package">
