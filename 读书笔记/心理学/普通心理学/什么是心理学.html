          <p>It’s a long time this easy, because the writer had to do handwork to prepared for the national computer rank examination. But now, after the examination I final have time for this easy.<br></p><p>For this easy , I want to talk something different .Now , let’s think about a question: what is psychology ?</p><p>If we should know the answer for this question , here are two relevant question also need to be done.  First question : how do psychology develop new knowledge?</p><p>In the easy we write before, we know that : the knowledge must come from practice(karl marx )</p><p>. it’s also true answer for this question , only the practice in the life can let us know new knowledge for the psychology . So , for to develop new knowledge ,the psychologist need to do more work in</p><p>experiment .</p><p>Ok ,so now how can we to design a proper examination to get new knowledge in psychology ? for a good exprienment ,we should do all these thing by order.</p><p>First ,developing hypothesis for phenomena ;</p><p>Second , performing a controlled test . It’s only the controlling test can get answer of the reason for the question .</p><p>Third, gathering objective date , for the test which we concerned most is the test data ,so we should get the first hand information to analysis question .</p><p>Forth , analysising result and accepting hypothesis or reject it. It’s normal for a psychologist that result data reject his hypothesis after his hard working test . So, we should chosen to accepting or rejecting hypothesis.</p><p>Fifth , publishing the hypothesis, maybe now we should call it ‘theory’ ,or criticizing and replacing the result if the hypothesis was rejected .</p><p>For a believable psychology examination , the variable in the test is not only just about itself, but also who do the test . The bias which we called “emotional bias” and “expectancy bias” are two very import</p><p>factors that can influence the result of test .</p><p>So , for controlling the bias which can influence the result ,we should do more work to prevent it’s happened . such as retest for every details.</p><p>The second main question for this easy: what are psychology’s six main perspectives ?</p><p>For the psychology’s developing process what we can know , all the psychology’s theory should be built by some special hypothesis, and we called them main perspective. In the psychology , there is six main perspective for it . and now ,let’s show it for you.</p><p>First : the separation of mind and body and modern biology psychology ;</p><p>Second : founding of scientific psychology and modern cognitive perspective ;</p><p>Third : behavior perspective : rejection of introspection and focus on observable ;</p><p>Forth : the whole-person perspective : psychodynamic psychology , humanistic psychology ;</p><p>Fifth : the development perspective : changing arising from nature and nurture ;</p><p>Sixth : the social culture perspective : the individual in context .</p><div class="image-package">
