## Big Data Review

#### 1. Java

the big data infra is build upon `java`, so, we can not study big data without `java`.

So, the first step of big data is `java`.

#### 2. Hadoop and Hive

big data has two main categories: real time and offline. The Hadoop and Hive is the most used offline big data analysis framework. 

Offline big data is much easier  than real time, so, the second stage, you should focus on this two framework.

### 3. Spark and Flink

This two tools were used for real time big data development. And the real time big data was related to Recommendation System and AD, I was much useful and it can generate more value.

Real time tools were the main task for third stage.
