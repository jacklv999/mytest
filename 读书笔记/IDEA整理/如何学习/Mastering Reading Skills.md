## Mastering Reading Skills

Four years ago, I had wrote an article ([Learning How to read ](./学读书.html)), and I use the rules in the article for my reading.

Now, I am going to step into a new phase, and I start to rethink some rules of this book. Because the failure and success I confronted told me that I need to change my way of reading. Of course, this is not meaning the rules in the last article is wrong, it just means I need to add new rules.

**I was always trying to do things for once and for ever.**  

This  is not wrong for anyone, but if we try to do things better, obv it will stuck us.  Because the world changes so fast, the things true yesterday may wrong today, and we are not perfect one, ergo, we may miss things when we first do some thing. So, the idea of doing things for once and for ever must be abandoned.

#### Deep Reading

In my new reading rules, I found that reading book deep are more important than reading more. Because the deeper you know, the more value you can deliver. So, how to do it ?

Here is the answer:

- First, understanding the whole book, and remembering all of it
    - Making sure that you know every word, every concept thoroughly!
- Second, trying to connect those knowledge to others, ergo, to make a mind map
    - Making sure that you know that 
        - why the author write this book, 
        - and why it wrote book in this way
- Third, using key word and key concept to rearrange this book
    - Making sure that you can repeat the whole book
- Fourth, imaging how this book use and what it can do
    - thinking out examples as more as possible
- Fifth, using it regularly in your life

#### Deep Reading Target

Besides, here is another target we can use: 

- **Making a speech on this topic for at least 30m**.

This is a simple and useful rule to exam how much you learn about this book.
