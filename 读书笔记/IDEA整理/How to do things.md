## How to do things

[TOC]

#### 1. Understanding Targets

When we starting do something, it is very important to make sure that we fully understand our target. For example:

- If we are going to develop a new product, we need to make it clear that what’s our requirements first;
    - then finding out the personas, survey their demanding, sorting their demanding;
- If we are going to take a task, we need to understand what we are expected first, including:
    - What we need to deliver? when should we deliver ? what’s the requirements for result product?

After we fully understand our target, then we can start our job.

#### 2. Measuring Feasibilities

There is no easy work, so it is important to understand the difficulties we are going to confront in the very mission. And, the goal of this part is to measure all difficulties, making it sure that whether this difficulties will stop us. 

The best way to measure difficulties is think thoroughly the whole task, and then comparing to what we know.

- If all the procedure are familiar with us, and we know the detail about whole task, then we can say it is totally feasible with confidence

But usually we don't know this mission before, so, it is important to search Internet, ask the experienced person or ask the leader to know it.

Measuring the feasibilities should be conducted in this way:

- First, measuring the macro importance
    - Does it matter in the current country atmosphere, industrial situation ?
- Second, measuring the micro importance
    - Does it meaningful for our company, our team?
- Third, measuring time feasibility
    - if you can not measure it, ask third-party;
- Fourth, measuring resource feasibility
    - Human resource
        - How many person do I needed ?
        - What knowledge and skills should I learn?
    - Financial resource
        - How much money do I needed ?
    - Material resource
        - What material do I needed ?

#### 3. Making The Roadmap

After the feasibility report, then we should make the roadmap. It is too hard to deliver the whole target in once and we also do not need to deliver it in the first time. So, we should to make a roadmap on what should we do in the every stage.

The key point for the roadmap are as follows:

- First, sorting the target;
- Second, dividing the target into different stage, and making every stage can be deliver, and do not skip too much between different stage

#### 4. Making Preparations

Getting all the resources we needed, including human resource, financial resource and material resource as soon as we can;

#### 5. Evaluating Preparations

Measuring all the resources and making the judge that can we start the work;

#### 6. Doing The Job Along With Roadmap

Start our job along with the roadmap;

#### 7. Revamping Roadmap In Real Time

changing roadmap in real time if we had any out of expect situation;
