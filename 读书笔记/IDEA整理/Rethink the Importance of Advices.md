## Rethink the Importance of Advices

#### 1. Why we need Cousulting ?

Every times, when we confront failures, there would be sounds about: you should listen to others advice before!

Yes, others advice matters for us, especially in the important situation. But, we still need reasons. Why we should listen to others advice? 

 â€™Cause I am overconfident person. I always believe that I can do any thing perfect as long as I try my best. This is my belief and the reason I wrote this article.  By the way, the very reason is my failure I just confronted, it let me know that my belief is wrong.

When I clam down and think careful about why we need others advices, there are my answer!

**Others knowledge** 

We are not god that knows everything, and we are bound to step into the unfamiliar area. So, the unknown things and task are we unavoidable part of life. Sooner or later, we are must to handle the task we do not known.

So, we need others knowledge. We need others to tell us that what is it !

Those knowledge can help save our time to know the fact and in case we missing the key information.

**Others way of thinking** 

In the second, everyone has its own limitations. We grow up in a specific situation, so we would have the way of thinking that fits this situation. We would assume that things would go on a specific model.

But, when we step into a larger world, we would be scrutinized by everyone and confronted unfamiliar things which may not happen as what we expect.

So consulting others in advance can give us a chance to avoid logical fallacy. Learning from others thought of how things would happen and runs.

**Others experience** 

Sometimes, others may have experience about similar situation. They have fight against such situation in the early time, they know the potential difficulties and traps.

**Others solution**
