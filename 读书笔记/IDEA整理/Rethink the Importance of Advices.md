## Rethink the Importance of Advices

- I do not like others opinion;
- I look down to others;

#### 1. Why we need cousulting ?

Every times, when we confront failures, there would be sounds about: you should listen to others advice before!

Yes, others advice matters for us, especially in the important situation. But, we still need reasons. Why we should listen to others advice? 

 ’Cause I am overconfident person. I always believe that I can do any thing perfect as long as I try my best. This is my belief and the reason I wrote this article.  By the way, the very reason is my failure I just confronted, it let me know that my belief is wrong.

When I clam down and think careful about why we need others advices, there are my answer!

**Others knowledge** 

We are not god that knows everything, and we are bound to step into the unfamiliar area. So, the unknown things and task are we unavoidable part of life. Sooner or later, we are must to handle the task we do not known.

So, we need others knowledge. We need others to tell us that what is it !

Those knowledge can help save our time to know the fact and in case we missing the key information.

**Others way of thinking** 

In the second, everyone has its own limitations. We grow up in a specific situation, so we would have the way of thinking that fits this situation. We would assume that things would go on a specific model.

But, when we step into a larger world, we would be scrutinized by everyone and confronted unfamiliar things which may not happen as what we expect.

So consulting others in advance can give us a chance to avoid logical fallacy. Learning from others thought of how things would happen and runs. This would be useful when we handle unfamiliar things.

**Others experience** 

Sometimes, others may have experience about similar situation. They have fight against such situation in the early time, they know the potential difficulties and traps. Listening to others advice may give us hints on how to avoid those traps.

**Others solution** 

Finally, ways to solve problems may various from one to one. If we can listen the voice from others, there maybe better solution for us.

Our own solution are restricted by our knowledge and experience, it is very likely that we choose a feasible but not best solution for our task. So, listening to others advices may do us a favor.

#### 2. When should we consult ?

Timing is also a big question for us. If we ask advice at the wrong time, it would make others annoyed or us looks stupid. Of course, Being look down or contempted is not a serious problem, but it have some weights. 

There are some important time points we should be careful:

- **Before giving the promise**

  When we have a new problem or task, it is important to know information as more as possible. The needed information are including but not limit to:

  - **Why**: Background information;
  - **What**: Task information;
  - **When**: Time information, including all key time points;
  - **How**: needed resources, methods, skills and know-how;

  If you are not sure about above question, asking the person giving you this task;

  If your are sure about above question, asking the **<font size=4 color=Red>outside or experienced one</font>** for different points of view. **<font size=4 color=Red>Trying to convince the other one !</font>** 

  Then, starting the preparation works!

- **Before starting**  

  our job can be categorized into two type of task: one is exploratory job, the other one is main job. For the exploratory one, it is ok to do it casually. But, for the important one: 

  When we start to do something, there must have a roadmap, including:

  - step by step targets;
  - step by step solution.

  If you are not sure about this roadmap, asking the person who give you this task;

  If you are sure about this roadmap, asking**<font size=4 color=Red> the person who did the similar task or experienced (What they would do ?) !</font>** 

- **When we having problem**

  When we have problem, it is very important to let the leaders know it. There maybe two result for the reporting: 

  - it’s no big deal, you can handle it;
  - it’s a big deal, we can skip this part; 

  Either one is not a bad answer. Of course, we can give the report that we are handling those problems by some solution, and it could be solved after some time.

  But, let the leaders know the issues and asking their advices is important. There are some reasons that make it matter:

  - If we can handle it, this action is a behavior to show respect;
  - If we can not solve this problem, this report could give leaders the expectation;
  - Besides, the leaders may give the better solution;

  In this time, others advice also matters. You should talk to **<font size=4 color=Red> the person who did the similar task or experienced !</font>** 

- **Before things settled down** 

  Before we summit our job, it is important to ask others advices.

- **After every thing** 

  When things are down, we should summary it. Figuring out:

  - How to evaluate this work?
  - Which part I did good? and what I should learn to emphasis?
  - Which part I could do better? and what I should bare in the mind to practice and make better ?
  - What I should do if I have the second chance ?

  **<font size=4 color=Red> Ask myself and others!</font>** 

#### 3. Who should we consult ?

There are different type of person we should bear in the mind:

- The person who know nothing about it
  - Ask them before your promise, start and settled down;
- The person did similar task before
  - Ask them when you starting and have problem;

#### 4. How to consult others ?

- Knowing their logic
- Knowing their information
- See the question from a different view;
