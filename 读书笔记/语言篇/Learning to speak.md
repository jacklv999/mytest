## Learning to speak

#### 1. Target

In recent interview and experience, I found that I am not really good at representing. So, I start to think the way out. 

First, the problem I found and I need to solve including:

- 1.Presenting what I want, ergo clearly representation
- 2.Being funny;

These two question are the target I am going to solve in this article.

#### 2. Clearly Representation

**First Rule**:

Being the important one and do not be the dancing monkey

**Second Rule**:

clearly representing what we want to say:

- Speaking conclusion first;
- Using 3 arguments to support our conclusion;
- Supporting our arguments with evidence;
- Making it clear and logic;
- Making sure that arguments independent, collective and exclusive;

**Third Rule**: **Framework** 

Using framework to optimize our represent !

Different jobs need different framework, the above framework may suitable for the most job, but it is not suitable for all job! So, it is important to find suitable framework for every single job.

**Q**: How to find the proper framework?

**A**: Timely summary and practicing by story repeat;

When you repeat lots of similar story or articles, you will find the framework that fitting it best!

**Fourth Rule**: **Repeat** 

Now, we know our target, but how can we do it?

**ANSWER**: 

- Speak as frequently as we can, practicing makes better;
- By repeating story, article, or our daily life;
    - Or impromptu speech by specific topic
        - Topic candidate: Shanbay daily news;
- **Note**: not only repeat to yourself, but also to others
    - it makes your know the think path of different people

#### 3. Being Funny

- find funny sentence
- find funny pattern

**U Formula**: 

A good story have three key element:

- Simple and clear background;
    - Should less 10% of your story;
- Character and interaction;
    - No interaction, no story;
- Zigzag story;
    - Zigzag makes funny

In a simply math function:

`Background - Setback - Worse - Turning Point - NewBorn` 

**Example**:

- Background: Sun has its problem, then we need to move the earth away;
- Setback: Earth engine breaks, although the world everything it can, it make no difference, our world maybe end here;
- Turning Point - UP: The man found another way out and try it best;
- Turning Point - Down: Although the man do its best and reach its target, but there is still a narrow missing. And the scientists give this results before;
- Turning Point - UP: the last hope, they did not count the spaceship, using this one, they reach their target and it succeed.

**How to train it**: 

**Repeat** 

Trying to repeat your daily life, article, stories as more as you can!

The practice makes perfect !

**Impromptu Speech**

Giving speech by random words, such as vegetable, ruler, car, stock and so on. 

It makes you to understand the relationship between things and to train your imagination!
